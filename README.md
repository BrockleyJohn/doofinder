## Overview
doofinder is a subscription-based services that provides, lightning fast, the closest matches for search queries using natural language processing and synonyms. It provides statistics that you can use to optimise your product catalog and lets you promote within the results - "searchandising".
- Customers who use the site search correlate with those who buy the most
- If a visitor doesn't find what they are looking for, you lose the value of that customer and the SEO that acquired them
- With doofinder, the proportion of searches yielding no results is reduced to less than 1%

## Site feed setup
We are going to set up doofinder to use your google products feed. If you don't already have one, a simple feed generator is included with this plugin. You will need a feed for each combination of language and currency that's available in your store.
Set up and generate your feed(s) first as you will need them when setting up doofinder.
## Doofinder Set up - Manual Method
Until a future update of the plugin that does this for you...
1. You will need a doofinder account for the setup. I suggest signing up at the free level until you are ready and then start the free 30 day trial of Basic or Pro once you're happy everything is working.
2. Log into doofinder and create your store - using your store URL and default language and currency.
3. Then specify the method to index your data as File Feed, the kind of information as Products sold in a store, and paste the url of the feed file that corresponds to the language and currency used above.
4. When you confirm step 3, doofinder starts indexing your feed file and displays the script url for your store - copy this and paste into the plugin
